## Element Challenge

### User Story

AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines  

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
