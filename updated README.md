# Code-Refactor-Starter-Code
User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Solution:

Code Refactoring: Refactoring existing code to improve its structure, readability, and efficiency without changing its external behavior.
Semantic HTML: Using HTML elements that convey structure to both the browser and developers, improving accessibility.
Web Accessibility Standards: Ensuring that websites and web applications are designed and developed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following established accessibility guidelines such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).

To address the challenge requirements, the following steps were taken:
Semantic HTML: Updated HTML elements to use semantic tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>, to better define the structure and purpose of different sections of the webpage.
Ensured that all HTML elements have appropriate attributes, such as alt attributes for images.
Reviewed and updated the content and structure of the webpage to improve search engine visibility and ranking, including the use of descriptive and relevant <title> and <meta> tags.
By implementing these solutions, the Horiseon Marketing Agency website now meets accessibility standards, resulting in improved user experience and enhanced search engine optimization.
